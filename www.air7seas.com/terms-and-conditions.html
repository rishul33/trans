	<li>Notwithstanding Section 1 of this BILL OF LADING, if the loss or damage occurred outside of the United States not during
sea carriage and it can be proved where the loss or damage occurred, the liability of Carrier in respect of such loss or
damage shall be determined by the provisions contained in any international convention or national law, which provisions:

separate and direct contract with Carrier in respect of the particular stage of transport where the loss or damage occurred
and received as evidence thereof any particular document which must be issued in order to make such international
convention or national law applicable.
</li>
	<li>If it cannot be determined when the loss of or damage to the goods occurred, liability shall be governed as provided in

with respect to the contents of each such container, except when the Shipper declares the value on the face hereof and
pays additional charges on such declared value as stated in Carrier's tariff. The freight charged on sealed containers when
no higher valuation is declared by the Shipper is based on a value of US$500 per container. However, Carrier shall not, in
any case, be liable for an amount greater than the actual loss to the person entitled to make the claim. Carrier shall have
the option of replacing lost goods or repairing damaged goods</li>
